# 86-box Demo Example

A GUI demo designed for control panel (480x480) which is usually used fo wall-mounted 86 type box.

**Note: This example is only applicable to 480 x 480 LCD.**

## How to use example

Please first read the [User Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/espressif-esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32s3/esp32-s3-lcd-ev-board/user_guide.html#esp32-s3-lcd-ev-board) of the ESP32-S3-LCD-EV-Board to learn about its software and hardware information.

### Hardware Required

* An ESP32-S3-LCD-EV-Board development board with subboard2 (480x480)
* An USB Type-C cable for Power supply and programming
* A Speaker

### Build and Flash

1. **The project configure PSRAM with 120M DDR(Octal) by default**. Please see [here](../../README.md#psram-120m-ddr) for more details.
2. Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

### Functions

Run the example, you can achieve a smooth graphic operation experience, for example horizontally swiping between weather report, hot water heater and warm air heater page. Trigger the control centre by swiping down from the bottom of the screen. Open music player to test the animation performance of the board.

## Troubleshooting

* Program build failure
    * Error message with `error: static assertion failed: "FLASH and PSRAM Mode configuration are not supported"`: Please make sure ESP-IDF support `PSRAM Octal 120M` feature.
    * Error message with `error: 'esp_lcd_rgb_panel_config_t' has no member named 'num_fbs'`: Please update the branch (release/v5.0 or master) of ESP-IDF.
* Program upload failure
    * Hardware connection is not correct: run `idf.py -p PORT monitor`, and reboot your board to see if there are any output logs.
    * The baud rate for downloading is too high: lower your baud rate in the `menuconfig` menu, and try again.
    * Error message with `A fatal error occurred: Could not open /dev/ttyACM0, the port doesn't exist`: Please first make sure the development board connected, then make board into "Download Boot" by following steps:
        1. keep press "BOOT(SW2)" button
        2. short press "RST(SW1)" button
        3. release "BOOT(SW2)".
        4. upload program and reset
